https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/



this repository mostly has to do with this website, and potentially the related ones later as I explore more of the language's functionality

many code examples contained here are either direct or modified versions of code examples there

secondarily this repository was created to learn how to use git, github, and rustrover together



although set to public this is not a meaningful repository
